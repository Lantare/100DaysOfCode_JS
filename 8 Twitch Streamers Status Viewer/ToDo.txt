FreeCodeCamp - Use the Twitchtv JSON API: 
https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api

Example: 
https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/

Hint: 
> See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at
    https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Front-End-Project-Use-Twitchtv-JSON-API

> The relevant documentation about this API call is here: 
    https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/streams.md#get-streamschannel

> Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: 
    ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]

_______________

TO DO:
User Stories:
> I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

> I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

> If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

> I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
