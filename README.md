# 100 Days Of Code JS

After reading Alexander Kallawayâ€™s 'Join the #100DaysOfCode' over here -> [link](https://github.com/Kallaway/javascript-koans) I decided to join in.

My reason for joining the #100DaysOfCode is to improve my JavaScript. 

Starting Monday(20th June) I will try to code 30-60min a day, and at the end of the 100 days attempt to tackle a larger project.

Full Progress Log: [log.md](log.md)
